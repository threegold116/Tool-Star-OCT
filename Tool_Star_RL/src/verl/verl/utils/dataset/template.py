# Here is a output example:

# <think>
# Let's break down the problem:

# Betty needs $100 for a new wallet.
# She currently has half of the money she needs, which is $100/2 = $50.
# Her parents give her $15.
# Her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents, which is $15 × 2 = $30.

# Now I need to calculate how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet.
# Money Betty has:

# Initial amount: $50
# From parents: $15
# From grandparents: $30
# ›
# Total money Betty has = $50 + $15 + $30 = $95
# Money Betty needs = $100
# How much more money Betty needs = $100 - $95 = $5
# Let me check this calculation using Python:
# <python>
# wallet_cost = 100
# initial_amount = wallet_cost / 2  # Half of what she needs
# parents_contribution = 15
# grandparents_contribution = parents_contribution * 2  # Twice as much as parents
# total_money = initial_amount + parents_contribution + grandparents_contribution
# more_money_needed = wallet_cost - total_money
# print(more_money_needed)
# </python>
# <result>5.0</result>
# The Python calculation confirms my manual calculation. Betty needs $5 more to buy the wallet.
# </think>
# <answer>
# The final answer is \[ \\boxed{{5}} \]

# If your knowledge is sufficient for you to reason, please generate the final answer with <answer> The final answer is \\[ \\boxed{{answer here}} \\] </answer>. the final exact answer is enclosed within \\boxed{{}} with latex format.
